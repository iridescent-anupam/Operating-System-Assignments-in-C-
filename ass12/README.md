Allocate an integer array of size N. Starting from the first index, sequentially access locations which are S units apart. For example, if N = 5 and S = 2, then indices 0, 3 and 5 should be accessed. Execute this for various combinations of N and S. For each combination, calculate the throughput (number of bytes accessed per unit time). Plot the throughput vs each combination of N and S. This 3-D graph is called "Memory Mountain".
